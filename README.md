# Mini game
A classic game of reaction speed

## How to use
You are given a 10x10 square field (blue), a "Start" button, an input field (N - time in milliseconds), and a score line (player/computer).
After clicking on the "Start" button:
1. A random cell in the field (blue) is highlighted in color (turns yellow).
2. If the player manages to click on the highlighted cell (yellow) within N milliseconds, the cell becomes (and remains) green and the player is awarded one point.
3. If the player does not have time to click on the cell (yellow) within this time, the cell becomes (and remains) red and the point is awarded to the computer.
4. If either the player or the computer scores 10 points, the game is over and the player should see a message about the game results in a pop-up modal window, otherwise the game continues from the first step.
